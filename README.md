# TissueMosaic

TissueMosaic (MOtif-based SpAtial Inferene across Conditions) is a Python-based software package for self-supervised analysis of spot- and cell-based spatial transcriptomics datasets.

Note
====

The codebase of TissueMosaic is currently maintained under the development codename _TissuePurifier_ and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/tissue_purifier). We are currently in the process of reorganizing the original codebase and porting it to the present repository (by the end of June 2024). Please stay tuned for updates.
